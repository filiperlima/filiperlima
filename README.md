## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Filipe, an independent Back End Engineer driven by a passion for solving complex problems. My expertise began with ASP, and I currently specialize in SharePoint, but I'm eager to transition to a Node.js role. Based in Brazil, I'm poised to launch my international career. I excel in translating customer pain points into tailored digital solutions, crafting impactful products that bridge the gap between vision and execution.
